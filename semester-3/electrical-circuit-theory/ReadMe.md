# TR with labs
in labs i have 1-st variant :3</br>
TR1 wrote longer (about 2-3 days) and better than 2-nd (in which i copy paste about > 50% from Levdorovich's work)
## Recommendation
I recommend use MathCad ver 7 and higher, because it has some backward compatibility with older one (like ver 13) </br>
